1. Gillespie's Direct Algorithm \
  Using Gillespie's Direct Algorithm, explore the five hallmarks in a SIR discrete event model: 
  * Variability 
  * Negative co-variances 
  * Increased transients 
  * Stochastic resonance
  * Extinctions 

Design a set of well chosen experiments to demonstrate all these aspects, also exploring the dependence on the basic           parameters in the model.
